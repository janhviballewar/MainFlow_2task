Key Features:
1.Sections for Each Page: The website has four sections: Home, Destination, Flight Class, and Date Selection. Only one section is visible at a time, simulating navigation between pages.
2.Colorful Backgrounds: Each section has a different background color to make the site visually appealing.
3.Dropdowns and Date Picker: The destination and flight class are selected using dropdowns, and the travel date is selected using a date picker.
4.Navigation: The navigation bar at the top allows users to move between different sections. Clicking a link changes the visible section.
5.JavaScript for Interactivity: JavaScript is used to control the visibility of sections and to handle the form submission.

How It Works:
1.The navigation bar links to different sections of the same HTML document, which are shown and hidden using JavaScript.
2.The form submission process collects the selected destination, flight class, and date, then displays these in an alert.

Overview of the Travel Booking Website Project:
This project is a simple, single-page travel booking website designed to allow users to select their travel destination, flight class, and travel date. It features a colorful and user-friendly interface, with easy navigation between different sections of the site, all within a single HTML file.
